I'm destined to get the first place!","Gone with the wind. Have you ever heard of that?","Time to show what I've got.","Are you all weighted with lead? That's slow!","C'mon! Please cheer for me, ladies!","The finishing line is right ahead! I'll win the first place for sure.","I'm the hare and you're all the tortoise. Hahahaha!","Forget it. The first place will be mine!","Rush! Victory is summoning me!",},

I'll catch up with you right away!","How about having a drink while listening to music after the race?","I haven't given it my all yet.","The result will be either you win the 1st place or I win the 2nd place...","I'm just one step to getting the first place! Fight!","Look at my body. I'm gonna win a place!","Only the first place makes a difference. The second and the fifth are just the same thing.","I don't need the second place!","This is my last chance! Arrrrgh!","That was close. I can't accept it!",},

I'll catch up with you right away.","Wait for me, you two!","Some people blame others for their lack of energy.","Hey you, I'll catch up with you right away!","C'mon! I'll be satisfied with the third place!","I don't want the third place! No way!","Never mind. I'll win the game next time!",},

I'm trying my best.","Don't look down on me. Anyone can slip.","Hey you, slow down. You dropped some Ingot.","Sometimes those behind only need some time to catch up. Trust me.","Stupid designer! The finishing line is so far away. I'm gonna get exhausted!","Oops, I don't think I can make it to top 3. Damn!","Arrrrgh! I can't be the last one!","Almost finished. I guess I won't be the last one.","Participation is the point, you know?",},

Don't you think I'm a slow runner.","The food was good today. I might have too much.","Gasp. I'm so tired. Can't run anymore.","Wait for me, all of you!","Should've gone to bed earlier. I'm so tired.","I'm tired, too. Gotta have a big meal tonight!","Who put laxative in my tea last night? My legs are too weak to run.","Slow down! I'm dropping out of the screen.","Did you take drugs? That speed is insane!","What are you looking at? I won the fifth place myself!",},
